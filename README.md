## Installation

Just clone this repo and open up index.html, don't worry about shadow-cljs stuff for now. Since this is a proof of concept, this is just rough stuff. 

You're going to need node and npm. If you don't have any of that, click here for installation. https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm

```bash
npm install
```

This should intsall all the dependencies including shadow-cljs.

Afterwards, run

```bash
npx shadow-cljs watch client
```

Then open up your browser to localhost:8080
